# Data-Storage-Architecture

## Overview

The report states the issues faced while storing a large amount of structured telemetric data into traditional nonrelational databases. Moreover, the report proposes a data storage architecture using nonrelational databases like document database (MongoDB), a graph database(Neo4j), object database (Amazon S3 bucket). The proposed architecture also uses tools such as IoT Endpoints, Kafka and Hadoop distributed file systems.
